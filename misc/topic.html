<p><em> </p></em>
<p><em>Virtual reality technology holds immense importance in the field of medicine. Its utilization creates a secure and immersive simulation environment, enabling physicians, surgeons, internists, and nurses to practice and gain invaluable experience in complex and high-stress situations. Notably, the cost-effectiveness of virtual reality training expands its accessibility to a broader spectrum of medical professionals. Furthermore, the immediate feedback provided by virtual reality simulations fosters a continuous learning process and enhances skill development. By integrating virtual reality into medical education, we can elevate the preparedness of healthcare professionals, leading to enhanced patient care and improved overall outcomes.</p></em>
